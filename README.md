# OpenMod

OpenMod is a config based on [ZoneMod 1.9.3](https://github.com/SirPlease/ZoneMod). The goal of this config it to be open to community feedback
and make the necessary changes to make the game more enjoyable and balanced.

I've discussed with many of the community members, and we mostly all agree that these changes 
needed to be made to ZoneMod. These tweaks are not set in stone and will probably
change to match community feedback.
