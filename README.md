# OpenMod

OpenMod is a config based on [ZoneMod 1.9.3](https://github.com/SirPlease/ZoneMod). The goal of this config it to be open to community feedback
and make the necessary changes to make the game more enjoyable and balanced. The source code for all my plugins is also available in my [sourcemod-plugins](https://github.com/LuckyServ/sourcemod-plugins) repository.  
  
Main changes include but are not limited to:  
  
- Scoring system based on health and temp health with heavy incap penalty
- No pain pills found in the map
- Tank rock lag compensation
- Low hunter claw damage
- Increased spitter damage
