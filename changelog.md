# OpenMod Changelogs

---

## OpenMod 1.0

- Enabled m2s on ladders
- Restored ZoneMod 1.9.3 smg values
- Hunter claw damage: 2
- Tank rocks are now lag compensated 
- Removed pain pills found in the map

## OpenMod 0.0.5

### Scoring system
- Implemented a new scoring system based on permanent health, current temporary 
health and potential temporary health. Damage bonus is no more!
- Survivors are heavily penalised for incaps and deaths (more than the current hybrid system).
- Perm: Permanent health (total amount of permanent health accross all survivors)
- Temp: Temporary health (bleeding health points, current and potential)
- The potential temporary health is the free temporary health you would get from getting picked up
after an incap.
- This scoring system accounts for bleeding (unlike the current hybrid system), so get moving!
- It also solves the problem of not being able to reduce damage bonus [because the survivors don't have enough health left](https://i.imgur.com/7kbi3hg.jpg).
